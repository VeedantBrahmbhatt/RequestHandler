### Building a Dynamic and Paginated Table with Expandable Rows Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

#### Introduction

In today's digital era, managing and displaying large sets of data efficiently is crucial. This blog post walks you through building a dynamic and paginated table with expandable rows using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for viewing records, with the ability to navigate through pages and expand rows for more detailed information.

#### Technologies Used

- **HTML**: To structure the content on the web page.
- **CSS**: To style the web page and enhance its visual appeal.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity and manage the functionality of the web page.

#### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a table that displays records in a paginated format. Initially, only 10 columns are displayed. Upon clicking a "+" button, the next set of 10 columns is revealed. Another "+" button allows users to expand and view an additional 5 columns. This approach keeps the interface clean and manageable, preventing data overload on the screen.

#### File Structure

The project is organized into three main files:

1. **index.html**: Contains the structure of the web page, including the table and pagination elements.
2. **index.css**: Defines the styles for the table, buttons, and pagination controls to ensure a cohesive and visually appealing layout.
3. **script.js**: Implements the logic for generating records, handling pagination, and toggling the display of additional columns.

#### Detailed Breakdown

##### HTML (index.html)

The HTML file sets up the structure for the table and includes placeholders for dynamically generated records and pagination controls. It defines the initial layout, with the first 10 columns displayed and expandable buttons for viewing more details.

##### CSS (index.css)

The CSS file styles the table and pagination controls, ensuring the layout is both clean and user-friendly. It includes styles for the table rows, headers, and buttons, as well as the pagination controls to facilitate smooth navigation.

##### JavaScript (script.js)

The JavaScript file handles the dynamic aspects of the project. It generates the records, manages pagination, and toggles the display of additional columns. The logic ensures that the initial 10 columns are displayed, with buttons to expand and reveal more columns as needed.

#### Functionality

1. **Dynamic Record Generation**: The JavaScript file dynamically generates records for the table, simulating a database of entries. This ensures that the table can handle a large number of records without manual entry.

2. **Pagination**: Pagination controls are implemented to manage the display of records across multiple pages. Users can navigate through pages using "Previous" and "Next" buttons, as well as page number buttons.

3. **Expandable Rows**: Each record initially displays 10 columns. Clicking the first "+" button reveals the next set of 10 columns. Another "+" button within the expanded section reveals an additional 5 columns. This tiered approach to data display keeps the interface clean and organized.

#### How to Run

1. **Set Up the Files**: Ensure that the `index.html`, `index.css`, and `script.js` files are in the same directory.

2. **Open the HTML File**: Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. This file links to the CSS and JavaScript files, ensuring that styles and functionality are applied correctly.

3. **Interact with the Table**: The table will display a set of records with pagination controls at the bottom. Use the "Previous" and "Next" buttons to navigate through pages. Click the "+" buttons to expand rows and view additional columns of data.

#### Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in creating dynamic and interactive web applications. By implementing pagination and expandable rows, we can manage and display large sets of data in a user-friendly manner. This approach enhances the usability of data-intensive applications, making it easier for users to navigate and interact with the information presented.
